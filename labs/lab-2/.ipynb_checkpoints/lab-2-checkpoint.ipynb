In general, a much better strategy is to get the computer to take complicated and error-prone derivatives for you! There are three general approaches that one can use in order to get a computer to take derivatives: [numeric differentiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_differentiation), [symbolic differentiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_differentiation), or [automatic differentiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation).  \n",

Automatic differentiation is the gold-standard but open-source libraries implmenting the techniques are rare (although there are several such libraries currently under development in Python). We will take a middle of the road approach and use symbolic differentiation via [SymPy](http://sympy.org/en/index.html) to compute the model's Jacobian."

    "## Capital depreciation rate, $\\delta$: \n",
    "The PWT provides estimated depreciation rates that vary across both time and countries. As an estimate for the rate of capital depreciation for country $i$ I use the time-average of $\\verb|delta_k|_{it}$ as provided by the PWT. \n",

    "A frequently used qualitative technique for analyzing systems of non-linear differential equations is to draw inferences from linear approximations to the system. Such linear approximations are derived from the Taylor expansion of the system around an equilibrium point. If the model has multiple equilibria, each equilibrium requires a *separate* linear approximation. While linear (or higher order polynomial) approximations derived using a Taylor expansion can give the exact value of the function at the point of approximation, the approximation errors may grow rapidly as we move farther away from the point of expansion. Same ideas apply to a linear approximation of arbitrary non-linear system.  At the point of expansion (typically some steady-state equilibrium point of the system), the linear approximation pinpoints exactly the same equilibrium of the non-linear system. For a sufficiently small neighborhood of the equilibrium point, the behavior of the linear approximation should be roughly the same as the behavior of the non-linear system. \n",

    "In the previous section, you found a linear approximation to the stable manifold $M_S$ that was only valid in a neighborhood of the steady state.  In this task, we will see how to solve for the full non-linear stable manifold using a \"forward shooting\" approach. The forward shooting method for finding $M_S$ proceeds by guessing a feasible value for $c_0$ and then using some IVP scheme to generate the implied solution trajectories for the variables $k(t)$ and $c(t)$. If the initial choice of $c_0$ is too small, then the solution trajectory eventually crosses the $\\dot{c}=0$ locus and $c(t)$ begins to fall.  Similarly, if the choice of $c_0$ is too large, then our path eventually crosses the $\\dot{k}=0$ curve at which point $k(t)$ will start to fall. These observations motivate the forward shooting scheme described in pseudo-code below for an initial condition $k(0)=k_0 < k^*$\n",

    "The difficulty in applying forward shooting methods to continuous-time, infinite-horizon problems is that the terminal state is extremely sensitive to the initial guess. However, this observation also implies that the initial state corresponding to any given terminal state should be relatively *insensitive* to the terminal state.  Thus better strategy for solving continuous-time, infinite-horizon problems is to guess a value for the terminal state and integrate the system of differential equations backwards to find the correspondign initial condition. This method is known as \"reverse shooting.\" \n",

Any initial deviation from $M_S$, however small, is magnified over time resulting in a path that increasingly departs from the exact solution. However, suppose that instead of computing the stable manifold, I wished instead to compute the unstable manifold, $M_U$.  As the figure below suggests, deviations from $M_U$, however large, become smaller over time.  \n",
